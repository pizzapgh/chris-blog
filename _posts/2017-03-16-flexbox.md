### Want to inline or float your columns?

Add display: flex to your parent container.

### Want them to stack?

Remove display: flex from your parent container.

### Want to change the order of the columns?

Add order property to your columns. Adjust 1, 2, 3 etc depending on the order you want.

### Want to adjust column widths?

Add flex property to your columns. Column 1 has flex:2. Column 2 has flex 2. Column 3 has flex 1.
You have to add your column margins manually.

### Or you can use flex-basis (flexbox way of saying width)

Add flex-basis to each column and add say... 35% on column 1 and 2 and 20% on column 3. The 10% left over will be your margins when you add justify-content: space-between on the parent container. Take a look at the second photo down below.

### Justify-content: space-between added to parent container.

Use this only when you use flex-basis on your columns. This will give margins to your columns. As long as your columns add under 100% of the parent containers width. Whatevers left over will be your margins using space-between.

### Other justify-content options; What if you want to align columns to the left, right or center them?

Add justify-content: flex-start to your parent container.

![alt text](/assets/left.png "flex-basis")

Add justify-content: flex-end to your parent container.

![alt text](/assets/right.png "flex-basis")

Add justify-content: center to your parent container.

![alt text](/assets/center.png "flex-basis")

### Want equal height columns?

No need to add anything. By default align-items is set to stretch on the parent container. This enables equal height columns.

### Oh, you don't want equal height columns?

Simply apply align-items to your parent container and add either flex-start, flex-end or center depending on what look you want. Examples below.

Add align-items: flex-start to your parent container.

![alt text](/assets/align-start.png "flex-basis")

Add align-items: flex-end to your parent container.

![alt text](/assets/align-end.png "flex-basis")

Add align-items: center to your parent container.

### Summary

I tried learning flexbox a couple of years ago and was put off by the lack of support and documentation. I decided to re-visit flexbox after reading that about 97% of all web traffic will be using browsers that support flexbox as of right now.

At first it seemed very confusing, but now it just makes sense and is a time saver for layout building.
I'm excited to start using flexbox for future projects. It's time to get on the wagon. You won't regret it.
